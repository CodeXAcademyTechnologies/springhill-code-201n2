  <h1>CSS positioning</h1>
  <p>We can move elements by declaring their left right bottom or top position. but css position properties such as
    static, relative, absolute, fixed, will determine how the rules are interpolated</p>
  <section>
    <p>This section with a red border uses the default positioning values "postion: static" see what happens when you
      change the positioning from static to absolute and then to relative </p>
    <article id="one">
      <h2>Position Relative</h2>
      <p>

        it will display exactly the same as before. until you assign left right bottom or top properties. this will
        assign
        positions relative to their original position with thier parent element.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article id="two">
      <h2>Position Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        this element will display relative to its most recent parent that has positioning set. if its has no positioned
        parent it will display relative to the page window.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article id="four">
      <h2>Help me pls!</h2>
      <p>
        this element is also absolutely positioned. however I am being hidden by the fixed positioner.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article id="three">
      <h2>Position fixed</h2>
      <p>
        this will position the element relative to its view port. it will stay in the same place even when the page is
        scrolled. it can block other content.
      </p>
