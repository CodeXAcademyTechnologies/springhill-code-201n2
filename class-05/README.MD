```HTML

```

### why

makes a more dynamic page.

give more content for the users brings some more life to the page.

we usually use colors and images to style our page and separate content so that the contents section is more clearly defined.

### what

JPEG(.jpg, .jpeg) joint photographic exports group

PNG (.png) portable network graphics

GIF (.gif) graphics interchange format

### how

#### Advantages

jpeg: it compresses small to large images that use natural light an colors.

png: png uses lossless compression which allows you to compress an image to much smaller sizes without loosing image quality. png supports transparency for images so that they dont collide with a background

gif: uses a similar type of lossless compression. is better for storing simple graphics with sharp edges and basic colors

#### Disadvantages

jpeg: it does not work well with: line drawings, shapes or text.

png: does not support embedding meta data and does not support non-rgb color spaces.

gif: only supports up to 256 different as opposed to a jpeg that supports around 16 million because of this the gif quality when using more than 256 colors is usually diminished due to the lack of available colors.

## how does images relate to you
