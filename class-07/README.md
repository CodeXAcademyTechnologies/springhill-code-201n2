# Object Oriented Programming with Constructor Functions and HTML Tables

## Overview

This class is the first of the two toughest classes in 201. We will be discussing inhereitance with constructor functions and we are going to be adding another dimension of DOM manipulation by introducing rendering a table based off of stored data rather than UL or OL with LI elements inside.

## How does this topic fit in

in the previous class:  we discussed the creation/ initialization and usage of objects inside of javascript.

in this classes focus: we will be learning about constructor functions and more about DOM Manipulations. We are going to use Constructor functions to instantiate stores then refactor our code from an unordered list to a more organized display of a table.

## Constructors

### why

- constructor functions are sued to initialize objects with the default or initial state.

### what

- a constructor is a function that is used to create object instances.

## Prototypes

## HTML Tables

```HTML
<table>
  <th></th>
  <tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tr>
</table>
```
